</div>
<h4 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
<li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
<li>2 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
<li>6 1/2 cups bread flour </li>
<li>3 tablespoons lard, softened</li>
<li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="steps">Steps</h4>
<ol>
<li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a large bowl. Stir in 2 cups flour, lard, and salt. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. When the dough comes together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
<li>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
<li>Lightly grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans.</li>
<li>Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into loaves. Place the loaves into the prepared pans, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)..</li>
<li>Place bread in the preheated oven and lower the temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake until the top is golden brown and the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped, about 30 minutes.</li>

<h3>Chicken Soup Ingredients</h3>
<ol>
<li>1. Chicken: I have prepared this soup using chicken breasts, bone-in skin-on chicken thighs, boneless skinless chicken thighs, a combination of each, and every other combination you can imagine. While there is no “wrong” chicken for chicken soup, if you plan to prepare your own “quick” broth as I explain in this recipe (different from chicken stock or bone broth), I find that skinless bone-in chicken thighs are the best. The broth is flavorful, but not overly fatty and the chicken remains juicy  unlike chicken breasts which are prone to drying out from prolonged boiling.</li>
<li> Broth: Prepare your own or use your favorite store-bought broth. For this recipe, I simply simmered chicken thighs in water to make the broth base.</li>
<li>Vegetables: Nearly every country has its own version of chicken soup. As such, each version will look and taste a little different from the next. The most common vegetables, however, include a mixture of onion, celery, and carrots</li>
<li> Herbs: Keep it simple or go wild, the herbs you choose to flavor your soup are entirely up to you. In this version, I left things super simple and only added a touch of fresh chopped parsley after the soup was finished cooking. Other popular herbs, dried or fresh, include oregano, rosemary, and thyme.</li>
<li>Optional: Try adding some anti-inflammatory ingredients including garlic, ginger, and turmeric. If you're new to cooking with any of these ingredients, start with a small amount and add more as needed.</li>

<div class="steps">
<ol>
<li>Make your broth: Since we're not making chicken stock, this should only take about 30-45 minutes at the most. Simply add the raw chicken thighs to a large stockpot, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil. Reduce to medium-low heat and simmer until the chicken is fully cooked. If you're short on time, skip this step and use your favorite store-bought chicken stock and add shredded rotisserie chicken.</li>
