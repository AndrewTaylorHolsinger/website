<div id="Intro">
    <p>In Exodus chapter 20; verse 13 God said,”You shall not murder.”So tell me, is killing a baby in the womb murder?to find this out we first must ask,”when does the embryo become a baby?”After only three weeks there is noticeable brain activity, and at five and half weeks the heart starts to develop.</p>
</div end of intro>
<div id="Point 1">
    <p> But isn't it “just a clump of cells?”If it is just a clump of cells how does that justify it? Aren't we “just a clump of cells?”If it is to control the population, why kill the next generation and not the old generation?It doesn't make sense, we are making it so that when we die there will be hardly anyone left!So is it murder?Yes I believe it is.This is outrages and should not be allowed to happen.The constitution says, “No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of LIFE, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”</p>

<div id="Point 2">
    <p>These Babies are innocent, yet they are being killed without reason, they are not going through trial.There are murderers who get to live a life of ease. In prison, getting fed three times a day by the taxes of families related to the ones they they murdered! They will maybe get put on death row, but will probably just die of old age in prison.But yet innocent babies who haven't did anything are being killed.Tell me how that makes sense, we kill the innocent and give our hard earned money to the people who wouldn't think twice about killing us! Do we want the worst people to be left in the world?</p>

    <p> My next point is that Abortion is unethical.What is the law of ethics?is it something written?Is it that feeling in our souls when we just know that something is wrong?The dictionary says ethics are,”Moral principles that govern a person's behavior or the conducting of an activity.”Basically it's what tells us what is wrong and right. So if I asked you if you would kill someone for one million dollars, ethic would say that is wrong and you should not do it. So would you? How about if you just had to “eliminate”a “clump of cells” in a womb? Doesn't sound as bad does it? What if you just had to “eliminate” a bigger “clump of cells”? That would be called murder. No matter what way you word it it is still murder. So why is it murder if you kill someone outside of the womb but not if you kill someone inside of the womb? It is messing up ethics! People don't know what's murder and what's not!</p>
</div>
<!--end of point 3-->
<div id="Point 4">
    <p>Some people argue that we should allow Abortion because girls are getting raped and need a way to get rid of the baby. But the truth is only about 1% of abortions are because of rape.That means that 99% of Abortions are just girls messing around and not wanting to take responsibility for their sin! So that argument doesn't even make sense to bring up. Even if they did get raped that does not give you an excuse to get an Abortion. God still made that Baby and has a plan for it! Sometimes They say,”My body my choice!”But is it their body?Or is it a body inside of their body?According to ethic, Abortion is wrong!There is absolutely no way that you can convince me that Abortion is fine.</p>
</div>
<!--end of point 4-->
<div id="Conclusion">
    <p>Frankly I think everyone else in the world is laughing at America right now.Because we are acting like a bunch of stupid idiots!According to God Abortion is wrong.Since God said it is wrong I will stand with Him! Abortion should not be allowed to happen, it is murder and is a sin!</p>
