<h1>Evidence of Divinity</h1>
<div id ="article">

<h3><p>
Divinity is everywhere. Everything from the certainty of consciousness to the fact that electrons stay in orbit around their nuclei roars the evidence of something indescribably ethereal and unfathomably powerful. I see in everything, an incomprehensible God who initiates all other comprehension, an unreal God who defines reality. We know God exists because we desire him. God is an inimitable God of whom we are all imitators, a supernatural being whose existence vindicates and expresses all that is natural, a timeless entity whose existence defines the institution of time. 
Understanding divinity has been an enigma for humans since the beginning of time. Everyone at some point in their existential founding has pondered his own powerlessness and his relation to what he sees as all-powerful. There are innumerable interpretations of the theme, ranging from a complete rejection of the idea of a universal divinity or even an immanent meaning, as in nihilism, to the fatalistic ideas of theological determinism and a more secular causal determinism. To discuss divinity, we must define the term. Divinity is the state or quality of being godlike or unearthly or really just "otherly." Divinity is so central to the human mind that the second one's paradigm shifts away from recognizing it, all axes of intuition and reason fade from truth to imitation to mockery. Understanding God requires us to admit his existence to validate our own musings. As many secular philosophers including Darwin, Hegel, and Sartre have uneasily admitted, if we are merely a product of chance molecular interaction, our dissertations on reality have no weight and no backing rationale. If we are as I know we are, creatures made to think and act and live as a fluid opus to the brilliance of the all-knowing One, our thoughts are substantiated by his existence as valid observations, whether true or not.<img src ="https://www.wkbn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2022/07/clouds-cloudy-sky-spring-summer-fall-winter-weather-generic-8.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1" width= 800 height=400 alt= "image of css html clouds"/>
God is reality. Following the previous argument's position in which humans cannot think without the existence of God, reality cannot exist without God. Human views of reality are limited to the individual's powers of perception. Unfortunately, perception is often disconnected from reality which means, if a person disbelieves in a divine reality and acknowledges the above fact, they can never be sure of any reality they believe. Reality according to humans is, quoting Philip Dick, "Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away." That definition, however, lacks a critical anchor. Who defines the reality that never changes? In Dick's mind, and more generally Kantian/Aristotelian thought, reality is something like a mean of global perception in which the sensus communis is taken as a whole and averaged. In this system, everyone's views are placed on this scale where ideas or feelings closest to that average, the ideas and feelings most agreed upon and felt, are reality. The fault with this in secular constructs is the lack of a unity of consciousness. All humans perceive reality differently and no one human or group of humans is in a position to prove their reality as the true reality. Also, this system eliminates the possibility of reality outside of human perception. The only way we can be assured of our perceptions as reality is when we compare them to a reality defined by someone we trust who is above our realities. 
God exists because we desire him.</p> </h3>
